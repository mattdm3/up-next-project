# up-next-project

A movie-rating app that allows users to find movies, rate movies, and get recommendations. Users can also create an "up next" list as they browse. 

## Built With

* ReactJS
* Firebase
* NodeJs

## Notes 
Due to server limitations on Heroku, the live version does not include the ability to get recommendations yet, though it is possible to achieve locally. 

## Acknowledgments

* For the recommender system I used the machine learning algorithm found here: https://github.com/mattdm3/movielens-recommender-system-javascript
* All movie information is taken from https://www.themoviedb.org/
